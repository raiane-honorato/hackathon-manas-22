[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/81006ea6-f2e3-4af8-bb6d-cf04a9127014/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nossolar/deploys)

This project was created in the Hackathon das Manas challenge. It is a response to the problem of home service being mostly the responsibility of women and being devalued by society. 

By creating a space for the family to define tasks collectively, learn to do them and monitor their execution, the Nosso Lar platform seeks to promote awareness of domestic service and a better division of tasks in the home.
